<moves><move><movename>Forensics</movename>
<movebody>When you study a dead body, ask the GM what killed it. If the death was mundane, the GM will describe the circumstances. If the death was supernatural, the GM will tell you the nearest mundane cause, plus what doesn’t fit that cause.</movebody></move>
<move><movename>Medic</movename>
<movebody>When you give a dying person your undivided attention you buy them time. They won’t die for at least a few moments and the GM will tell you what you can do to keep them alive longer—maybe even avoid death entirely.</movebody></move>

<moveinstructions>Choose two:</moveinstructions>
<moves><move><movename>Tell</movename>
<movebody>When you talk to someone and can carefully study them you can ask the GM if they’re lying about any given statement, as often as you please. The GM will answer truthfully.</movebody></move>
<move><movename>Muckraker</movename>
<movebody>You’re known for bringing down people (deserving or not) with your stories. If you report on something with the barest of evidence you can be sure the proper authorities (local police, most likely) will get involved as soon as your story hits. This may not be a good thing, but at least they can’t kill you without somebody asking questions, right?</movebody></move>
<move><movename>Camera Man</movename>
<movebody>You’re used to taking your own photos. Unless you’re physically denied a working camera, you always have photographic evidence of every place you’ve been. Not that everyone will believe it.</movebody></move>

<movebody>You always know who’s in the know. When you seek information, you can always ask the GM “who might know more about this?” The GM will answer truthfully, including where that person can usually be found.</movebody></move></moves>
