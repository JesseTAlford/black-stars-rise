<name>Take a Risk</name>
<normalversion>When you attempt something risky, roll. The GM may tell you to add:
<ul><li>Fit, if it requires physical power or resilience</li>
<li>Sharp, if it requires quick thinking</li>
<li>Steady, if it requires mental fortitude and nerves</li></ul>
On a 10+, it goes as well as could be hoped. On a 7–9 there’s a complication, the GM will give you a tough choice. On a 6-, the risk turns out badly, the GM will describe how.</normalversion>
