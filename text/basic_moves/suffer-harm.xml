Take -1 ongoing to this move until you receive medical attention or spend a few days recuperating. On a 6–4 your injuries catch up to you. The GM will wound one of your moves. On a 3-, it’s life-threatening. The GM will wound two of your moves. If you don’t have two unwounded moves, you’re dying.</normalversion>
